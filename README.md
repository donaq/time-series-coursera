# Time Series Coursera

I am currently taking a course on [time series analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis/home/welcome) in Coursera. Unfortunately, the course is in R and I really want to learn this stuff in Python (for work), so I am doing the course but converting all the code to Python (numpy, scipy, scikitlearn, pandas, matplotlib, etc.) I am a total noob in all of those as well, so I am either killing two birds with one stone or overreaching. Hey, nothing of worth comes easy. Hopefully this eventually becomes useful for others as well.

## Usage

Before running jupyter, add the repository root directory to PYTHONPATH so that you can import `utils`
